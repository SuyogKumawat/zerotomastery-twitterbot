# ZTM Twitter Bot

Our twitter bot is for the ZTM community. It automatically likes, follows, and retweets anyone who uses the
`#zerotomastery` or `#ztm`. It also follows the instructors Andrei, Yihua, and Mrdbourke and replies to anyone who mentions it.

- Hi everyone, welcome to the ZTM Twitter Bot group. We will be building a twitter bot for the ZTM community that will automatically like, follow, and retweet anyone who uses the #zerotomastery hashtag or #ztm, it will also follow the instructors Andrei, Yihua, and Mrdbourke. I am actually on vacation for the first week of this hackathon, so I have tried to get everything set up for you to succeed without me. I have set up cards on the trello board with everything we need and a github repo for you to use. I will try to respond to questions in this channel and on trello as soon as I can, but I encourage you to ask in #helpme or other relevant channels, and try to google things to find your answers while I am away. I don't want anyone to feel stressed out about this, I created 2 working bots within a week without ever touching python before, so this is not a difficult project and I have linked to great tutorials and docs on the relevant trello cards. Please try to grab the cards that sound fun to you, assign yourself to it, and move it to in progress on the trello board. You may help each other out by using this room to work together and figure out the problems. In my experience this was quite hard to test if it was working as its hosted on heroku and a live bot, I had to wait on incoming tweets to see if it worked. Because of this, when I get home, I will go over all the code that is finished and I will pull it and test it locally as I have the .env tokens needed to do this. Below I am going to link all of the things you need to get started. Thank you for joining and I hope you all have fun testing out your python skills!
